# love.hs
A terminal startup application that encourages you, the user, with supportive positive messages and warm rays of sunshine!

You can add your own messages in the following .txt files:
* lovegreet.txt -> Messages used to greet the user.
* lovemsg.txt    -> Messages used to lovingly support the user. 

## What you need to get it running:
* Every single module in the import header.
* Edit whatever startup file you use, .bashrc, /etc/profile, and set it to run this functional program. For less clutter, hide the program in some hidden folder and add it to your profile file! 
* Ex) ~/love/love or ~/.love/love

Todo:

* ☼ Add colors to terminal.
* ☼ Implement logic structures to make user aware of what they need to wear outside due to weather conditions.
* ☼ I don't know what else.
* ☼ Kill myself.
