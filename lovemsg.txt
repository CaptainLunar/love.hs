You really impress me!
If opportunity doesn't knock, build a door.
Believe in yourself! Have faith in your abilities! 
You yourself, as much as anybody in the entire universe, deserve your love and affection.
If you think you can do a thing or think you can't do a thing, you're right.
The difference in winning and losing is most often.. not quitting.
Success is failing nine times and getting up ten.
Happiness, like unhappiness, is a proactive choice.
When the world puhes you to your knees, you're in the perfect position to pray.
Love yourself.
Have an awesome day!
The best way to gain self-confidence is to do what you are afraid to do.

I will always find a way and a way will always find me.
Self-confidence and self-courage are your greatests strengths.
All things are difficult before they are easy.
Know yourself.
